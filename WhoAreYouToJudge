String q2 = "A police officer sees a man being assaulted and tries to intervene. \nThe police officer is supposedly shot by the assaulter. \nThere are several eye witness testimonies saying that the assaulter shot the cop, but there is no DNA evidence. What's your judgement? \n\nHit the left side for guilty and right side for innocent.";
String q3 = "The defendant, an 18-year-old high school senior, walked into a school and began to shoot innocent classmates with an automatic assault rifle. \nBy the time police apprehended the defendant, 4 of the defendant’s classmates were killed, and 12 were injured. He was tried as an adult and found guilty of premeditated murder. What's your verdict? \n\nHit the left side for Death sentence and hit the right side for Life Sentence.";
String q4 = "Lee and Pitts were charged for the death of two white men, although no physical evidence linked them to the deaths of them.

Would you convict them? \n\nHit the left side for YES and the right side for NO.";
String q5 = "On the night of April 19, 1989, Trisha Meili, a 28-year-old white woman was attacked and raped by 8 people in Central Park. \nPolice suspected that a group of Black and Hispanic teenagers raped Meili, although no DNA evidence was found. \nHowever, the group of teenagers confessed to the crime. Would you convict them? \n\nHit the left side for YES and the right side for NO.";
String q6 = "Richardson was charged for the poisoning of his child. \nThe prosecution argued that Richardson committed the crime to obtain insurance money, although this policy didn’t exist. \nThe primary witnesses against Richardson were two jail-house snitches whom Richardson was said to have confessed to. Do you think Richardson is guilty? \n\nHit the left side for innocent and right side for guilty.";
String q7 = "Bloodsworth was charged for the rape and murder of a young girl. \nThere were several eyewitnesses that claimed that Bloodsworth murdered and raped the girl. \nHowever, Bloodsworth had alibi witnesses. Would you convict him? \n\nHit the left side for YES and the right side for NO.";

What is your verdict? \n\nHit the left side for Death Sentence and the right side for Life Sentence.";

Later on, 7 of the 9 witnesses recanted their original accusations. Amid numerous innocence protests for Davis, he was executed on September 21, 2011, 20 years after the initial sentence. ";

String e4 = "Check your assumptions. \nHere's what actually happened... \n\nAlthough no physical evidence linked them to the deaths of two white men, Lee and Pitts’ guilty pleas, the testimony of an alleged eyewitness, and incompetent defense counsel led to their convictions. \nThe 2 men were sentenced to death. Later, another man confessed to the crime, the eyewitness recanted her accusations, and the state Attorney General admitted that the state had unlawfully suppressed evidence. \nThe men were granted a new trial, but were again convicted and sentenced to death. \nThey were released in 1975 when they received a full pardon from Governor Askew, who stated he was “sufficiently convinced that they were innocent.";
String e5 = "Check your assumptions. \nHere's what actually happened... \n\nProsecution of the 5 defendants in the case was primarily based on their confessions they had made after police interrogations. However, none had counsel during their questioning. Later, they each withdrew these confessions and pleaded not guilty. In addition, none of their DNA samples matched with Meili’s. Still, 4 of the 5 in the case were convicted of rape, assault and other charges. After the real rapist was identified in 2002, these 5 convictions were vacated. In 2003, the 5 men sued the City of New York for malicious prosecution, racial discrimination, and emotional distress. After a change in administration, the city settled in 2014 for $41 million.";
String e6 = "Check your assumptions. \nHere's what actually happened... \n\nPost-conviction investigation found that the neighbor who was caring for Richardson’s children had a prior homicide conviction, and the defense provided affidavits from people to whom he had confessed.\nRichardson’s conviction was t7u hrown into further doubt when the governor appointed District Attorney Janet Reno to conduct a special investigation. \nShe concluded Richardson’s conviction should be vacated. \nAt a subsequent court hearing, the court overturned his conviction.";
String e7 = "Check your assumptions. \nHere's what actually happened... \n\nWhen it was discovered that the state failed to disclose exculpatory evidence, Bloodsworth received a new trial, at which he was convicted and given a life sentence. \nHe was released after subsequent DNA testing confirmed his innocence.";
String e8 = "Check your assumptions. \nHere's what actually happened... \n\nAfter attempts to resuscitate her son, Butler rushed to the hospital, but her son died. \nThe following day Butler was arrested for child abuse due to the bruises left by her resuscitation attempts. \nThen, in 1990, she was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Her conviction was overturned by the Mississippi Supreme Court in 1992. \nThe court said that the prosecution had failed to prove that the incident was anything more than an accident. \nAt retrial, she was acquitted on Dec. 17, 1995 after a jury deliberation. It is now believed that the baby may have died either of cystic kidney disease or from sudden infant death syndrome.";
String e9 = "Check your assumptions. \nHere's what actually happened... \n\nThe court sentenced Alcaca to death in 2010. \nThen in 2013, he received an additional sentence of 25 years to life after pleading guilty to two homicides committed in New York in 1971 and 1977. \nIt is believed that the total count of victims range from 8 to 130.";
String e10 ="Check your assumptions. \nHere's what actually happened... \n\nThe Florida Supreme Court threw out Hayes’s conviction and the DNA evidence in 1995. \nThe victim had been found clutching hairs probably from her assailant. \nThe hairs were from a white man, whereas Hayes is black. \nHayes was acquitted at a retrial in July, 1997.";
